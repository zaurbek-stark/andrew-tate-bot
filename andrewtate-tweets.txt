 The message cannot be stopped\n\nWatch here:\nhttps://rumble.com/v1hz6jh-the-message-cannot-be-stopped.html
| The key to real networking is not greed. \n\nIt’s generosity.
| The feeling of superiority is intrinsic to masculine contentment.\n\nYou feel happy when you feel BETTER than others.\n\nWe’ve evolved to compete.\n\nYou have to climb the highest mountain to breathe fresh air.\n\nOtherwise, your air is the recycled breath of the average.
| Clearly, being cancelled is hitting @cobratate hard. His life really sucks right now. Good thing he doesn’t believe in depression\n\n🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
| "Bro I got an opportunity for you!"\n\nYeh. Lucky me.\n\n98% of the people who talk to me want my money one way or another.
| I’m trying to awaken the LIONS of the world.
| Avoid the easily tricked. \n\nThose that obey what they are told without thinking for themselves. \n\nThey’ll be the first to turn on you in a police interview.\n\nBetrayal is certain. \n\nAnd betrayal is betrayal, whether they were “tricked” into it or not.
| You all have the ego. \n\nBut absolutely none of you are prepared to do the work to justify it.
| Success requires efforts that nobody sees before you achieve anything worth while. \n\nMost of you require outside validation - being told “good job” - for motivation. \n\nIf nobody notices the work. \n\nYou don’t do the work. \n\nLearn to TELL YOURSELF GOOD JOB.
| The beauty of life as a man is the endless potential to be ANYTHING \n \nYou can build yourself into a monster \n \nPhysically and financially \n \nYou can do near anything, simply with applied focus and aggression \n \nYou can be a CHAMPION
| Young Kings.\n\nI’m never “on” a diet because I’m never “off” a diet. \n\nMy entire life is a diet. \n\nNutritionally.\nEmotionally.\nFiscally.\n\nEtc. \n\nFavorable results are born from self-control. \n\nAvoid the on/off, It’s easier and more effective to adopt this as a lifestyle.
| You think I can’t stick you but your girl will trick you. 
| IT’S IMPOSSIBLE to be sad when you’ve been through hell and are IMMENSELY proud of yourself and all you’ve achieved.\n\nYou’re never going to be happy unless you’re better than everyone else.\n\nThis is the true masculine desire.\n\nSuperiority is imperative.
| Work ethic and ambition are not your problems.\n\nGuidance is.\n\nYou’re spending time on fruitless endeavors, guided by people who have never been where you want to go.
| Take a good look at your day to day life, and compare it to every other average person in the world.\n\nLook how similar it is, look how similar your mindset is, take a good hard look at yourself.\n\nYou think your end result will be THAT much different?
| The average man’s achievements are nothing to be proud of.\n\nWhen you hear TATE, you think exceptional professionalism.\n\nMake your name MEAN something.
| My life is like a movie.\n\nWhy isn’t yours?
| If you want the happy tomorrow’s. \n\nYou need the truths that hurt today.
| Never have friends who WON’T FIGHT. \n\nCan’t fight is bad but semi forgivable. \n\nWon’t fight is inexcusable.\n\nAT LEAST TRY? This is life or death. \n\nMost of you are cowards so you happily roll with cowards. \n\nThere’s a word for this in the animal kingdom. \n\nPREY.
| Those inside of the matrix have no idea about the massive opportunity which exists OUTSIDE of the matrix. \n\nAre you brave enough to see the real world?
| My favorite answer to people when they complain about their problems is. \n \nI do not care. \n \n1) Because I don't. \n2) Neither does anyone else. \n3) It offends them and makes them angry. \n \nThen I say good. Direct that anger towards a SOLUTION and stop TALKING. \n\nACTION &gt; TALK
| Young Kings.\n\nA man does not acquire a full skill-set to be told “Take Care” “be careful” by amateurs.  \n\nRaw action solves everything. \n\nCaution breeds fear.

| THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF LOSERS 🤓😂\n\nNew TateSpeech:\nhttps://rumble.com/v1hq7sb-the-different-types-of-losers-.html
| I thought I was cancelled? \n\nSo how am I on a 75million dollar yacht with 30 beauty queens. \n\nTurns out nobody can cancel the TOP G. \n\nFollow rumble.com/tateconfidential to see the Top G lifestyle. \n\nFollow rumble.com/Tatespeech to see the Top G conquest. \n\nFollow both and retweet this for a chance to win a bedroom on the next yacht trip. \n\nTOP G TOP STRIKER. 
| KS bi 
| Imagine WANTING to go to the gym. \n\nImagine being excited by challenges, enjoying struggle, embracing hard work. \n\nThe successful don’t have to convince themselves to do the right thing. \n\nThey WANT to. \n\nIf you fix your thoughts, your life will fix itself.
| It’s never too late to have a happy memory of a bad time.
| It’s your job to bring honor to your last name.
| Rumble.com/tatespeech \n\nJoin the revolution against the Matrix. 
| I have so much love in my life. \n\nSo many people are amazed by my tenacity and success. \n\nSo many people genuinely adore me and want the absolute best for me. \n\nIt’s a win win, as I have never once disappointed somebody who cares about me. \n\nI am truly blessed.
| I have 4 spare bedrooms on my yacht. \n\nAnyone wanna come?
| From the second I was born, I was raised to be happy via personal achievement and exceptionalism. Competition and combat. \n\nYou were raised to be happy via entertainment and distraction from reality. Cartoons and TV. \n\nThis is why you fail in comparison.
| It’s easy to manipulate a brave man into a fight. \n\nIt’s easy to manipulate a coward out of a fight. \n\nThe true skill is when you can manipulate either party into acting against their instinct. \n\nThis is what a LEADER does.
| Imagine being a young man and not taking risks. \n\nNot only are you missing the chance for monumental improvement - but you’re wasting a chance to hone a very important masculine skill. \n\nThe unaided negotiation of difficulty.\n\nRisk more.
| At the heart of every weak man is pity. \n \nSelf pity. \n \nLonging for strength they don't have. \n \nToo weak to build it. \n \nHating those who have it. \nIt's impossible for a weak man to be truly happy within himself. It's biological and evolutionary. \n \nStrength is happiness.
| My dad always used to say “OUTSTANDING IN THE RAIN”\n\nAs opposed to simply “outstanding” when he was impressed. \n\nI asked him. \n\nDad, why the rain?\n\nAnd he replied \n\n“Son, any jackass can perform when the sun is shining”
| Being rich teaches you that life’s all about people. \n\nA 75million dollar yacht is boring without true close friends around. \n\nAnd with true close friends… a 75 dollar hotel would be fun too. 
| You don’t know what you don’t know.
| You are the creator of the universe. \n\nYou have created your own story and now you’re living it. \n\nDid you fail?
| Everything you want to attain in life is possible. \n\nIt is at the top of the mountain.\n\nYou MUST earn it and work for it.\n\nNothing is given, and nothing earned is withheld.
| You don’t know the intimate details of anyone else’s life. \n\nYou only see the highlights. \n\nMaybe this is hard to believe. \n\nBut, what if... with every single detail included... \n\nYou were already living the best life on earth?\n\nYou might just be. \n\nDo you appreciate it?
| A lone wolf’s goal is survival.\n\nA pack’s goal is to thrive.
| Think of all the things you figured out entirely on your own.\n\nAll the time it took, all the time wasted, all the opportunities missed.\n\nHow can you adapt to the world fast enough with only one pair of eyes and ears?\n\nHow can you compete?
| You are so comfortable living without an edge because you never exploited it in the first place. \n\nYou’ve never once pushed yourself to the true physical or mental limit. \n\nYou’ve been coasting through life and semi-failing forever.
| Never let yourself become a hater. \n \nIt’s the most pathetic existence possible. \n \nIf someone bothers you - forget they exist. \n \nPouring energy and emotion into someone who thinks of you never is a losing game. \n \nYou will feel pathetic. \n \nYou will look pathetic.
| Sometimes in life there is simply no room for error.\n\nAt 200mph, or with cold steel aimed at your NECK.\n\nThere is no realm for "OOPS". No second tries.\n\nAs a PROFESSIONAL you must get it PERFECT, FIRST TIME.\n\nAmateurs die.\n\nYou need to be THIS good. Go train.
| Andrew Tate Livestream 2022-08-26
| Cancel culture is so effective because every single “man“ with a platform is a coward. \n\nThey come for me with some obvious bullshit and everyone who loved me instantly CHANGES and agreed with the matrix. \n\nScared of having any true beliefs besides the one they’re ALLOWED to have. \n\nThat’s why individuals get hung out to dry. \n\nLogan Paul’s boyfriend Mike, KSI and one thousand others were singing my praises till the ban came. \n\nThen they crapped their panties and changed course. \n\nCowards!
| I'm gonna live forever\nI'm gonna learn how to fly\n\nTATE!\n\nI feel it coming together\nPeople will see me and cry\n\nFollow the revolution.\n\nRumble.com/

| Speed is the difference between success and mediocrity.\n\nEvery week you wait and “think”\n\nYou diminish the rewards and increase the risk.

| The average man is unprofessional in nearly everything he does. \n\nHow he walks. \nWhat he says. \nWhen he talks. \nWhere he looks. \nWhat he knows. \n\nHow he drinks a glass of fucking water. \n\nIf you became a professional you would realize exactly how EASY life is.
| They can not stop us. \n\nWe have torn the fabric of space time. \n\nJoin the movement. \n\nWe go LIVE on Rumble TONIGHT. \n\nRumble.com/tatespeech
| Life is absolutely easy when everything is approached clinically. \n\nSystematically. \n\nI haven’t “forgotten my keys” in fucking YEARS. \n\nThere are no mistakes.\n\nProfessionals THINK. Why is your mind only HALF ON?\n\nIf everything goes right. Nothing goes wrong. \n\nDo you understand?
| Winners never quit.
| The better the excuses you can find for failing. \n\nThe less guilty you will feel for failing. \n\nAnd you’ll become more likely to fail.
| TIME and SPACE are linked. \n\nPLACES are not important without TIME as context. \n\nThe same PLACE was once war, peace, communist, democratic, raining, sunshine. \n\nWHERE only has meaning with the WHEN. \n\nBut the true secret to the universe is the link between HOW and WHY.
| Go laugh in places you cried. \n\nGo win in places you lost. \n\nRewrite history.
| Most people are SLOW.\n\nThey hear about something, sounds like a good idea, hmm.\n\nSome time goes by,\n\nHear about it again, hmm, still sounds good, will think about it harder tomorrow.\n\nFew days go by...\n\nAh yes! *thinks more*\n\nI’ll do it next week!
| Examine every belief you strongly hold and ask WHY you strongly adhere to such belief.\nIf the answer isn’t “personal experience” \n \nYou’ve been PROGRAMMED. \n \nFor better or worse. \n \nBy someONE or someTHING. \n \nASK! \n \nWho? What? When? \n \nAre they my enemy? \n \nResist the slave mind.
| Stage 2….
| Andrew Tate’s Final Message\n\nhttp://freetopg.com/
| If energy isn’t real. \n\nHow can you feel when somebody is being off?\n\nHow do you feel when something is wrong?\n\nOr danger?\n\nEnergy is very real. \n\nIf you’re paying attention.
| Don’t pay much attention to what people say. \n\nBut spend considerable time analyzing WHY they said it. \n\nWhat did they want you to think?\n\nOr to feel?\n\nTo reply?\n\nIdentify motives to prevent leaving weakness for an attack.
| The past isn't real.\n\nYesterday isn't real.\n\nIt only exists in your mind along with the fairy tales you were told as a child.\n\nAnd the days you remember are remembered completely differently by somebody else.\n\nIt doesn't exist.
| There is a psychological barrier preventing you from achieving things the FIRST time.\n\nBut achieved ONCE, there is little doubt that you could do it AGAIN.\n\nAfter the first time I knocked someone out, I knocked everybody out.\n\nI didnt hit any harder.\n\nI just believed I could.
| The universe has a strange sense of balance.\n\nOften, the person who wins - deserved to win.\n\nAnd the loser deserved to lose.\n\nOnce you've genuinely worked to deserve the life you want, I mean, ACTUALLY struggled and tried... you'll often find you have it.
| Have you ever looked at your life when everything's a mess and thought...\n\n"Ok, no more fuck ups. Time to focus and get serious"\n\nYou should try doing that with your life when nothing is wrong and everything is going well.\n\nThat's how you end up at the top.
| If you can keep your head when all about you   \n\nAre losing theirs and blaming it on you\n\nIf you can trust yourself when all men doubt you\n\n\nBut make allowance for their doubting too; \n\n\nIf you can wait and not be tired by waiting,\n\n\nOr being lied about, don’t deal in lies,\n\n\nOr being hated, don’t give way to hating
| Recovering from failure is great.\n\nNever failing is better. I have never failed.\n\nDo not be inspired by men who wasted most of their life and managed to crawl back to normal.\n\nBe inspired by men who never wasted a second and sprinted towards excellence.
| The easiest way to motivate a man is to point it out to him he’s a loser. \n \nObjectively and indisputably. \n \nI am MORE SUCCESSFUL than you. \n \nIf that FACT doesn’t motivate him to fight. \n \nIf he isn’t PROUD enough to TRY and beat me. \n \nHe’s a lost cause.
| Lack somewhere?\n\nExcel somewhere else. \n\nCounter your weaknesses by honing other capabilities. \n\nUgly? Get filthy rich \nPoor? Be strong as an ox \n\nLife is unfair. \n\nThe primary focus of your energies is to balance the books.
| When war arrives - you soon learn who your most capable soldiers are.\n\nIt’s not the smartest people you have. \n\nIt’s not the strongest people you have. \n\nYour most capable soldiers will always be comprised of two key elements. \n\nAbsoluteiy loyal to the cause and follow orders without prejudice. 
| There is no upper limit to disaster, the worst you can imagine can be worse still. \n\nLife’s misery is unlimited.\n\nLife’s happiness is in short supply.\n\nIf you’re honest with yourself, you probably enjoy much more happiness than you deserve. You didn’t earn it.\n\nBe thankful.
| Ours scars have the power to remind us that the past was real.
| Be very careful who you let onto your ship. \n\nMany men will try to sink it if they can’t be the captain.
| Pain can teach.\n\nIf it doesn’t hurt much - you learn nothing.\n\nIf it hurts a lot - you’ll learn something.\n\nBut some pain is absolutely devastating, it hits like a train and destroys your ability to grow.\n\nYou don’t learn anything.\n\nYou simply suffer because it hurts too much.
| The only real exam that matters is being smart enough to know WHO to learn from. \n\nAnd trust me - it’s not your university professor. \n\nIt’s a man who already HAS what YOU WANT.
| Action is more effective than manifestation. \n\nAction is more effective than dreaming. \n\nAction is more effective than hoping. \n\nAction is even more effective than planning. \n\nDO. MORE. \n\nGO.
| Some men take action and get successful. \n\nSome watch others win and wonder why they lose. \n\nWhich one are you?
| A group can only move as fast as the slowest member. \n \nSociety is a group, laws are the speed. \n \nLAWS are designed with losers in mind. So ANY idiot can survive. \n \nIf you are a genuinely exceptional man you will gravitate towards renegade. \n \nVagabond. \n \nAn evil gentleman.
| SHOWING the most emotion doesn't mean you FEEL the most emotion.\n\nAnd showing less emotion doesn't mean you feel less.\n\nStone-faced men feel pain.\n\nVery often more pain than crying and screaming.\n\nEmotional control isn't lack of emotion. It's a necessary function of maturity.
| Life has taught me that if you genuinely desire something, the universe will provide it to you 100% of the time.\n\nThe cosmos is giving. \n\nI have NEVER not ONCE truly wanted something and didn’t get it. \n\nDreams don’t come true? You simply didn’t want it enough.
| Most men cannot fight.\n\nMen think they can fight.\n\nHow many times have you been attacked?\n\nActually attacked?\n\n1. Maybe 2.\n\nPro fighting is the closest legal replica - how many fights have you had?\n\nHow can you be good at something you’ve never experienced or practiced?
| Winners are the men who are willing to lose.
| What did the Amber Heard scenario teach us?
| "I think XYZ!"\n\nGood for you.\n\nBUT are you HAPPY?\n\nYou look miserable.\n\nYou openly brag about your "depression" and "anxiety"\n\nAnd youre trying to convince ME to think like YOU?\n\nNo thank you, I will never adopt the thinking of someone who is sad.
| "I just wanna nap lol"\n\nOne day you are going to DIE\n\nThere is a finite period of HUMAN TIME you will experience.\n\nTIME is the most VALUABLE thing you will EVER have.\n\nUnderstand? No?\n\nOk. Go back to sleep.
| Most people are desperate for calm.\n\n “I just wanna relax on the beach”\n \nI enjoy chaos. Give me a rough sea. \n \nGive me 9 companies and 8 girlfriends and stress and tears and fights and supercars. \n \nI don’t WANT to relax. \n \nThis is the biggest reason I’m rich.
| Brute willpower is universally applicable.\n\nGym, quitting smoking, not txting that girl.\n\nOpen a can and smear it on anything for favourable results.\n\nThe inability to force smart action from yourself is a fast track to failure.
| 80 years ago you would have been in a trench under artillery fire for a war you barely understood hoping to come home in tact with valour. \n\nToday all you need to do is make a little money, fuck a few bitches and stay in good shape to be “the man”\n\nAnd you’re depressed?
| I am full of love for everyone. \n\nI harbour no ill will. \n\nI live with a pure heart and I shall stay this way until the day my time is up. \n\n
| Every time someone doesn’t listen to my advice on how to get rich, I’m happy.\n\nWhy?\n\nBecause I know.\n\nIn a few months, when they see EVERYONE who did listen richer than ever, and the opportunity has long passed,\n\nThey’ll think.\n\n“I should’ve just listened to nice guy Tate”
| The key to being proud of yourself is always making decisions you can be proud of. \n\nWhat decisions could somebody else make that would make you admire them?\n\nOk. So do that, as that’s what you respect in someone. \n\nHold yourself to your own standards.
| I was born with zero money but very rich. \n\nI was born with something very valuable:\n\nThe ability to shut up and listen to those who knew what I didn’t know. \n\nTo learn and obey without being lazy or ungrateful. \n\nFighting. Cash. Chess. No matter.\n\nSuccess was absolutely assured.
| They want to break my spirit.\n\nSome men aren't built that way.
